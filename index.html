            <h3>What Is General Liability Insurance and Why Does It Matter?</h3>
            <p>General liability insurance protects your business from third-party claims involving bodily injury, property damage, and advertising injury. It’s essential coverage for any contractor or small business because accidents can happen, and a single claim could put your business at risk without the right coverage in place.</p>

            <h3>How Workers’ Comp Protects Your Business and Employees</h3>
            <p>Workers’ compensation insurance helps cover medical costs and lost wages when an employee is injured on the job. In California, it's required by law for most businesses with employees. It also protects business owners from legal liability while ensuring employees receive care and support.</p>

            <h3>Fleet Safety: Why Commercial Auto Coverage Is a Must</h3>
            <p>If you or your employees drive vehicles for work, commercial auto insurance is non-negotiable. This policy covers business-owned vehicles and protects against liability in case of accidents, property damage, or injury. Having the right coverage can save you from costly lawsuits and downtime.</p>
